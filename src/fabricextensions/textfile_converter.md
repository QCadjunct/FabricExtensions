# textfile_converter.py

## Overview

`textfile_converter.py` is a versatile Python script designed to convert various file formats into plain text. It supports a wide range of formats including PDF, Microsoft Office files (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX), structured data formats (JSON, XML, YAML, CSV, Parquet), SQL files, and even images (via OCR). The script can handle both local files and URLs, and it intelligently manages file encodings to prevent decoding errors.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-format Support**: Converts a wide variety of file formats to text.
2. **URL Handling**: Can download and process files from URLs.
3. **Intelligent Encoding Detection**: Uses the `chardet` library to detect file encodings.
4. **Dynamic Module Loading**: Automatically installs required Python modules if they're not present.
5. **OCR Capability**: Can extract text from images using OCR.
6. **Flexible Output**: Can output to a file or print to console.

## Main Components

### 1. Module Loading

The `load_module()` function dynamically loads required Python modules, installing them if necessary. This allows the script to handle various file formats without requiring all dependencies to be pre-installed.

### 2. File Conversion Functions

- `convert_pdf()`: Extracts text from PDF files.
- `convert_office()`: Handles Microsoft Office files (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX).
- `convert_structured()`: Processes structured data formats (JSON, XML, YAML, CSV, Parquet).
- `convert_sql()`: Parses and formats SQL files.
- `convert_ocr()`: Performs OCR on image files.

### 3. URL Handling

The `download_file()` function allows the script to download files from URLs, making it possible to process remote files.

### 4. Main Conversion Logic

The `convert_file()` function serves as the main entry point for file conversion. It determines the file type based on the extension and calls the appropriate conversion function.

## Usage

To use the script, run it from the command line with the following syntax:

```
python textfile_converter.py <input_file> [output_file]
```

- `<input_file>`: Path to the file you want to convert, or a URL.
- `[output_file]`: (Optional) Path where the converted text will be saved. If not provided, the text will be printed to the console.

### Examples

1. Convert a local PDF file:
   ```
   python textfile_converter.py document.pdf converted.txt
   ```

2. Convert a remote DOCX file:
   ```
   python textfile_converter.py https://example.com/document.docx
   ```

3. Convert an image and print to console:
   ```
   python textfile_converter.py image.jpg
   ```

## Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling:
- It attempts to detect and use the correct file encoding.
- It provides informative error messages for HTTP errors when downloading files.
- It catches and reports general exceptions during the conversion process.

## Dependencies

The script dynamically installs required dependencies, but the main ones include:
- chardet
- PyPDF2
- python-docx
- openpyxl
- python-pptx
- pandas
- sqlparse
- pytesseract
- Pillow

## Limitations

- OCR functionality requires `tesseract` to be installed on the system.
- Some file formats may require additional system libraries to be installed.
- The script may not handle very large files efficiently, as it loads the entire file content into memory.

## Conclusion

`textfile_converter.py` provides a powerful and flexible solution for converting various file formats to plain text. Its ability to handle multiple formats, process remote files, and automatically manage dependencies makes it a valuable tool for text extraction and processing tasks.
